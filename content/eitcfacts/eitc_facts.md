# EITC Facts  
**Blurb**
Here are some facts about the EITC that I find are not frequently documented.

## Investment Limits  
*  Investment income limits were introduced in via Public Law 104-7
*  Investment income about the limit precludes a worker from receiving any EITC
*  Sources

## Earned Income and AGI  

*  One typically pictures the EITC schedule as a trapezoid.
  -  Initially the credit increases with income in the phase-in portion.
  -  Between the two kink points is the max credit portion that is constant with income.
  -  After the second kink point the credit declines with income.
*  However, after the first kink point, the credit is determined by the max of earned income and adjusted gross income (AGI).
  -  AGI is gross income minus some deductions and weakly greater than earned income.
  -  Thus AGI includes some unearned income.
*  Increasing income past the first kink point reduces the credit
  -  For some tax units, this erases the max credit portion and makes the EITC look triangular.
*  Weber (2016) discusses and uses this for identifying variation
  -  Caroline Weber, 2016. "Does the Earned Income Tax Credit Reduce Saving by Low-Income Households?," National Tax Journal, vol. 69(1), pages 41-76, March.
  -  She finds that the EITC disincentivizes saving because of this feature.
