### Basic Concepts  

##  What is economic development?
At one extreme, imagine a subsistence economy that requires each person to provide their own food and shelter and  do not interact with others in a market. 
People are poor because they spend all their time catching and growing the food they need and trying to keep from getting sick in their self-made houses.
Now, at the other extreme, imagine an economy where each person makes or provides a specialized service, earns a steady income, and then trades with others for food, shelter, and other more luxury goods.
Because each person does what they are best at, people have time for relaxing.
We might say that the diversified economy is developed because specialization and well-functioning markets allows people to do what they are best at and plan for the future.

Thus,  the simplest (and bluntest) definition is the process of evolving from the low income, subsistence economy to the high income, diversified economy.

## What is development economics? 
Development economics is the study of how economies develop and also why they are not already developed. 
For part of the class,  we will consider growth theory that tries think economically about how  a country develops. 
To some extent this tells us about what economies should do at the macro-level; e.g., invest in education or save more. 
For other parts of the class, we will consider what keeps people from pursuing these strategies more forcefully and consistently.
We will learn about the realities of being poor in developing countries and how this affects what choices individuals make and how those can aggregate to keeping a whole country impoverished.

## How is economic development measured?
There is no one answer to this question. 
Countries are not at the two extremes of either subsistence or perfectly specialized.

Some approaches that have been suggested are:
* Average or Median Income or GNI per capita
* Percent of Population Living Under $1 a day
* Life Expectancy 
* Human Development Index 
* Percent Agriculture in Economy
* Family Size 
* Access to Healthcare
* Literacy or Average Grade Level
* Corruption Index

Each variable captures and misses some aspect of development.
Typically, we associate developing countries as being `poor' but, if we focus solely on income, then we will miss out of the other aspects such as individuals pursuing their passions if they live in an oppressive regime or if they lack the ability to keep their children healthy and educated.
By and large, there is an assumption that if we can increase people's income then the other aspects of development will follow. 
However, when we study the lives of impoverished people we will see that just giving people more money likely would fail to bring long term change.

## What is the distribution of the development indicators?
